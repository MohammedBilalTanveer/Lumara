# Image Setup Instructions

To add Nikhil's profile image to the website:

## Method 1: Direct File Copy (Recommended)
1. Copy your image file from `/Users/bhavya/Downloads/Nikhil.jpg`
2. Paste it directly into the `/public/` folder 
3. Rename it to one of these options:
   - `nikhil.jpg` (if it's a JPEG)
   - `nikhil.png` (if it's a PNG)
   - `nikhil.jpeg` (alternative JPEG extension)

## Method 2: Drag and Drop (Alternative)
1. Make sure your image file has the correct extension (.jpg, .png, .jpeg)
2. Drag the actual image file (not a text file) into the /public/ folder
3. Rename if needed to `nikhil.jpg` or `nikhil.png`

## Current Status
The website is expecting the image at `/nikhil.jpg` - so make sure your final file is named exactly `nikhil.jpg` in the `/public/` folder.

## File Types Supported
- .jpg / .jpeg
- .png
- .gif
- .webp
- .svg

## Once Complete
Delete this README file and the incorrect .tsx file.
